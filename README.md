# How do I enable mods in my WRCG Install?

1. Either compile, or download a copy of `WRCGUnpackager.exe` from the [releases](https://github.com/Avery3R/WRCGModTools/releases)
2. Place `WRCGUnpackager.exe` into the installation directory of WRCG
3. Launch it, and wait for it to complete.
4. If successful, inside of `Common\Settings` there should be a file called `settings.cfg`, open it and change `Engine.UsePkg = true;` to `Engine.UsePkg = false;`.
5. All done :)
